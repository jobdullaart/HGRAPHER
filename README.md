# HGRAPHER

HGRAPHER is a model that can be used to generate hydrographs representing the typical evolution of a storm tide level over time. There are two scripts on this github page, named functions and master. The master script can be used to run the functions defined in the functions script. Time series of surge and tidal levels are required as input. The scripts are set up in such way that it can only handle timeseries with a 10-minute frequecy. The easiest way to run HGRAPHER is by using time series available from the CoDEC dataset. These time series are available from the Copernicus Climate Data Store CDS: https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.8c59054f. Users can also force HGRAPHER with other time series obtained from tide gauges or other hydrodynamic models. A global dataset of hydrographs corresponding to the 1-in-100 year storm tide level return period is available from the 4TU data repository at https://doi.org/10.4121/21270948 (link becomes active when published).
